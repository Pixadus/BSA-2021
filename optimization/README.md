## IDL Occult Parameter Optimization

Many of these files were written by Kevin Reardon for use in optimizing OCCULT-2 parameters when compared with manual measurements of solar fibrils of a given region.

Maximum of both percentage columns is
4	45	35	2000	2000	1	0	3	0.941964	0.933682

NSM1 = 4
RMIN = 45
RMIN = 35
NSTRUC = 2000
NLOOPMAX = 2000
NGAP = 1
THRESH1 = 0
THRESH2 = 3

THRESH1 and THRESH2 were not found to have any impact on the percentage values. 

The resulting raw datafile from these parameters is found at data/occult_results/occult_output.dat
