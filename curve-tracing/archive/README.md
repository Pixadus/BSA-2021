# Curve Tracing

This script is designed to trace solar features, with the ability to do so both manually
and automatically via OCCULT-2. 

## Manual

The manual tracing is going to be a mini vector-drawing application. This will involve: 

1. Drawing lines using several points connected with straight lines
2. Drawing lines using BÃ©zier curves
3. Deleting lines using an eraser tool

`ESC` will deselect the currently used tool, and right-click will delete the last placed point.
